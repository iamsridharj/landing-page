# Commercetools Frontend Application

This project is a frontend application utilizing the commercetools API, designed to showcase how to interact with commercetools services using a modern JavaScript stack. The application is built with React, TypeScript, and styled-components, providing a robust foundation for scalable and maintainable code. Additionally, it leverages Prettier, ESLint, and CRACO to ensure code consistency, quality, and enhanced customization of webpack configurations without ejecting from Create React App.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **styled-components**: Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter.
- **ESLint**: A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.
- **CRACO (Create React App Configuration Override)**: Allows you to customize the webpack and other configurations of Create React App without the need to eject, providing more control over the app's setup.
